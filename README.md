# Why make this?

My teacher takes off marks for not following the (unofficial) [Turing Style Guideline](http://wiki.compsci.ca/index.php?title=Turing_Style_Guideline) to the letter. Well, guess what? This class is way too boring, and Turing too horrible a language, for me to learn anything. Thus, I shall use this project to learn how to use NodeJS.

## But...why NodeJS?

Ruby is too slow, and I'm too lazy to install Python on this partition, so NodeJS it is.
